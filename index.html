            <h2>Income Inequality:</h2>
            <p>In economics, income inequality is defined as: <blockquote cite="https://www.britannica.com/topic/income-inequality">"a significant disparity in the distribution of income between individuals, groups, populations, social classes, or countries"</blockquote> Income inequality has been growing across the world, and has only been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This site will focus specifically on the rampant income inequality in the United States of America.</p>

            <h2>Just How Bad Is It?</h2>
            <p>Rather than try to explain how bad the gap is, showing data and charts will better display just how bad things have gotten.</p>

            <h2>How Did It Get This Bad?</h2>
            <p>The worst offender for why wealth gap is larger than ever is the system we live in that allows it to happen, capitalism. Under this system, the only motivator is profit. Because of this, all corporations do is seek higher and higher profits to please stock holders and at the expense of the working class. There is no incentive to treat their working properly, since doing so requires spending money.</p>
            <p>Another contributing factor is the erosion of taxes on the 1%. Ever since the 1940's, the taxes the rich have to pay have steadily decreased. This has allowed them to accrue massive mountains of wealth since the rich can afford to sit on their money and not spend it.</p>

            <h2>What Can Be Done About It?</h2>
            <p>While Income Inequality has only gotten worse in recent years, there are a number of solutions that could help reduce the sever disparity between the rich and the poor in the USA.</p>
            <ol id="main-list">
                <li>Taxing the Rich</li>
                <li>Minimum Wage Increases</li>
                <li>Access to Free/Cheap Healthcare</li>
                <li>More Affordable Housing</li>
                <li>Unionizing the Working Class</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The first solution, and one that can help solve a large number of issues aside from just income inequality is taxing the rich. The majority of the wealth disparity in the US comes from the top .1%, who earn on average 196 times more per year than the bottom 90%. This should not be the case. The taxes on the rich have been eroded since the 1940's, and need to be restored. The money taxed from the rich should be used to fund social programs which can help those at the bottom not be stuck in an endless cycle living paycheck to paycheck.</p>
            <p>Another solution is to increase the minimum wage. This would allow people who have been stuck with poverty wages since 2009 to earn more money and allow them to afford the basic needs in a modern society. Fortunately, President Joe Biden has pledged to increase the minimum wage to $15, but the rate the wage is set to increase isn't enough. The people needed a $15 minimum wage years ago. A better solution than just changing the minimum wage to a set a rate of increase so that the minimum wage would keep up with inflation.</p>
            <p>Better access to healthcare is a whole other issue, however the prohibitively high cost of medical care in this country is a huge barrier for working class people. Working class people filing for bankruptcy because of medical bills or avoiding medical treatment all together is all too common in the richest country in the world. The last thing people in the USA should need to worry about is if they will be able to afford a vial of life saving medication or procedures.</p>
            <p>Affordable housing is another huge issue in the United States. Landlords and the owner class are able to charge absurd amounts of money for rent in an apartment since there are few other alternatives. Public housing is few and far between, fill up fast, have strict requirements, and are generally seen as undesirable to live in. Housing should be a guaranteed human right in this country. Everyone who wants a home should have the ability to rent one at low cost.</p>
            <p>Finally, the working class needs to get together and unionize to make corporations give them fair compensation for their labor. As has been proven over the last few decades, corporations will not fairly compensate their workers if given the opportunity. The United States either does not provide or severely under provides basic workers rights such as maternity/paternity leave, paid vacation, and pensions. The only way to get corporations to provide these things is to unionize, and force the issue upon them.</p>
